Dream Big:

Be the architect of your adventure! What do you want to do? Where do you want to do it? Who do you want to do it with? Explore the possibilities, create an event and share it with the people you love!

When Can You Go?

Set a date.
Match it with your buddies.
Get going!

Timing is Everything:

What are you waiting for? Go, go , go!
Don't leave your buddy waiting!

Problem to Solve:

Finding multiple locations based on an activity the user and their friends want to do.
Having a place to brainstorm remotely with your friends about the activities, destinations, and dates to go on your trip all in one place.

Solving the Problem:

On landing at our site, 
User selects an activity, after destination populates user makes a choice and is taken to the event page where they will choose a possible date for the trip.
User then saves the event to a database, on save they will create a name for the event, create a log in if one does not previously exist.
When they have completed the save event they can now send a templated email to their friends to invite them to join the group event created.
